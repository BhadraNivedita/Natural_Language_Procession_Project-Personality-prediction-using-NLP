# Description of the data set (Source: Kaggle)

The Myers Briggs Type Indicator (or MBTI for short) is a personality type system that divides everyone into 16 distinct personality types across 4 axis:

Introversion (I) – Extroversion (E)

Intuition (N) – Sensing (S)

Thinking (T) – Feeling (F)

Judging (J) – Perceiving (P)

This data was collected through the PersonalityCafe forum, as it provides a large selection of people and their MBTI personality type, as well as what they have written.
